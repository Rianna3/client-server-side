      Human inventions and technologies have shaped civilizations and
      transformed life on the Earth. As expectations and capabilities evolve,
      each generation cultivates its own set of innovative thinkers.
    </p>
    <p id="A">
      Right from the invention of the wheel to the development of the Mars
      rover, a large number of these inventions have been truly revolutionary,
      even if hadn't been so obvious at the time.
    </p>
    <p id="A">
      Most major inventions don't have just one inventor. Instead, they have
      been developed separately by many people, or many people have had a hand
      in their evolution from basic concepts to useful inventions.
    </p>
    <p id="A">
      We will discuss about a list of our top picks of revolutionary inventions
      that changed the world.
